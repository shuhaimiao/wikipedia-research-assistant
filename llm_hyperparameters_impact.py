Hyperparameters SIGNIFICANTLY impact MCP tool selection:

🌡️ TEMPERATURE:
   - Low (0.1-0.3): Consistent but rigid tool selection
   - Medium (0.4-0.6): Balanced consistency and flexibility ✅
   - High (0.7-1.0): Creative but inconsistent

🔝 TOP-K/TOP-P:
   - Conservative: Reliable but may miss edge cases
   - Balanced: Good for most MCP applications ✅
   - Exploratory: Unpredictable, less suitable for production

🎯 FOR MCP SYSTEMS:
   - Consistency is more important than creativity
   - Users expect predictable tool behavior
   - Test extensively with your specific tools and prompts
   - Monitor and adjust based on real-world performance

Remember: Even the most capable LLMs need proper hyperparameter
tuning for optimal MCP tool selection!
